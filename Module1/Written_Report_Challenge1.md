## Overview of Project
@@Analysis (12 points)@@
@@The written analysis has the following:@@
@@Explain the purpose of this analysis.@@
This project was the first challenge in the Carleton University Business Analytics and Data Visualization Boot Camp.  Module 1 of the first Unit of the boot camp was intended to enhance our Microsoft Excel skills in a number of areas including statistical modeling, forecasting and prediction.  These skills included the use  pivot tables, charts and graphs to improve the audiences understanding of what the analysis had revealed.
### Purpose
@@Overview of Project@@  
@@The purpose and background are well defined (2 pt).@@
The purpose of the specific project within this module was to assist a client, Louise who came close to, but failed to meet her goals in funding a play named Fever.  It is not clear why Louise wants this information but I am assuming that she probably want to make another more fucsed attempt to fund this play.  As we strive for perfection we will definately be giving Lousie the best information available.
## Analysis and Challenges
@@Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.@@

@@Analysis and Challenges@@
@@The overview of the analysis is well described with screenshots (2 pt).@@
The analysis followed the general process of breaking the available data into catagories and subcategories that were appropriate to Louise's needs.  She was interested in thetre and in particular plays.  I looked at two specific factor that may influence the goal outcome, those being lauch date and the actual goal amount.  This data is presented in line chart to show trending.  I also did an anaylsis by country and extract three candiates to discuss with Louise.  The country data is presented in two small tables.

I created a number of views to verify the analysis was correct and meaningful.  I did observe that there was an issue in the project define requirements in that the Outcomes based on Goals last row said Greater than 50000 and the second last row said 45000 to 49999.  This did not affect the values because there were no goals of exactly 50000 for theatres - it would cause issues for other campainge.  I correct this I changed the goal to be Greater than 49999.  Another issue was that I wanted to give Louise better data about what she could do in the future so I created a couple of pivot table that allowed be to extract data that I specifically wanted to discuss with her.  The last item is that the first row was a much smaller range that most others and the last was of course so a line chart could be somewhat deciving - the trend in meanful zones was however valid and I have address this in the explaination.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
