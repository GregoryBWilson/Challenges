# Challenges
## Nov 13th
- I created the Challenges fold and the Module1 folder and cloned it to my computer using GitBash.  
- I download the final report template and copied it using the move command.  
- I pushed these changes up to GitHub.  
- I did have some permission issues as it seemed the folders were in use by another application so I had to finally reboot the computer to free the folders up. 
## Nov 14th 
- I am typing these changes directly into GitHub to see what I need to do to get them included on my computer.  
- I am also practising Markdown formating and Preview the file here in GitHub
- I will commit the changes here and then try to pull to my computer using GitBash  
- Works like a charm!
- Added Excel spreadsheet to my folder and pushed to GitHub
- Edited the spreadsheet on my computer and pushed to GitHub.
- There were 2 files that changed, appears to be the spreadsheet the .git folder in the main repository folder?
- Life is good [:smile:]("#" ":smile:")
- Added this emoji above, just for fun!  
![This Alt Text just tells the coder what he or she is trying to insert](/Test.png "This is the Title of the image that floats under the image")
- Added a test picture *Be careful not to put a space between the ]( brackets!* **It took me a while to figure this out**  
- Just played with text style above
