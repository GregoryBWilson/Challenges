# Challenges
## Nov 13th
- I created the Challenges fold and the Module1 folder and cloned it to my computer using GitBash.  
- I download the final report template and copied it using the move command.  
- I pushed these changes up to GitHub.  
- I did have some permission issues as it seemed the folders were in use by another application so I had to finally reboot the computer to free the folders up. 
## Nov 14th 
- I am typing these changes directly into GitHub to see what I need to do to get them included on my computer.  
- I am also practising Markdown formating and Preview the file here in GitHub
- I will commit the changes here and then try to pull to my computer using GitBash  
- Works like a charm!
